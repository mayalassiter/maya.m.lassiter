%0D%0A
%0D%0A
We demand that there is no increase in the FY 2021 budget for the Philadelphia Police Department. If a budget includes an increase for the Police and cuts for our community services, Council, you must reject it.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
After years of outcry over police getting a pass for violent acts and murders, we demand no budget increases for the Philadelphia Police Department.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
Mayor Kenney has put forward a budget that cuts almost $650 million from the programs that our city residents need to survive, while increasing the police budget by at least $14 million.

When the Department of Public Health is slated for an over $8 million cut during a global pandemic, when projects that put leaders of color on the street to stop violence are defunded, when Parks and Rec programs that save lives every summer are shuttered and face a $13 million cut, we demand no increase for the Philadelphia Police Department - and that you reject any budget that increases police funding and cuts the services our communities need.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
At a time when our Public Defenders faces a huge cut, when our community colleges and libraries are getting cut $10 million each, we demand no increase for the Philadelphia Police Department.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
The programs that reduce violence in our neighborhoods are libraries, they are rec centers, they are the interlocking networks of care and support that are funded through our tax dollars and are animated independently by our communities.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
We demand in this moment that we defund the police to make up for the shortfall of what truly keep us safe. WE KEEP US SAFE!
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
The police have shown consistent disrespect for Black and Brown people. They have brutalized us in our neighborhoods and at protests for our lives and dignity. We do not need to supercharge their budget for more injustice.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
Philadelphia City Council must reject this budget unless it removes the $14 million dollar increase allocated for the Philadelphia Police Department and instead fully funds resources to our libraries, our rec centers and our communities.
%0D%0A
%0D%0A
We plan to testify at the public hearing on June 9th on the urgency of this demand, and funding our communities. If those slots are already full, we also demand you open at least one, if not two, more public testimony hearings for our people to speak at this unprecedented time on these vital issues.

I'm a Philadelphia resident and I am contacting you to ask that you, Councilmember Bass, work with Mayor Kenney to significantly revise the proposed city budget.  %0D%0A %0D%0A City Council must fully fund services working people rely on, rather than increasing the budget for Philadelphia’s police and worsening the racially disproportionate impact of COVID-19.  %0D%0A %0D%0A
I know you are committed to standing with Black and brown communities in Philadelphia, who have been hardest hit by COVID-19’s economic and health impacts. I believe that the most just and effective way to support Philadelphia’s recovery from COVID-19 is to pass progressive tax measures so that corporations and the ultra-wealthy are required to pay their fair share, instead of balancing the city’s budget on the backs of working Philadelphians. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Will you work to stop layoffs and budget cuts to city services that will disproportionately affect Philadelphia’s most disenfranchised residents and further entrench people in poverty? 
Will you work to reallocate funding from Philadelphia Police Department to city services such as our libraries, parks, homeless services, adult education, arts and culture? %0D%0A %0D%0A Increasing the PPD budget by $14 million while they use & incite violence to actively devastate our neighborhoods with extreme force in response to peaceful protests IS A CORRUPT ALLOCATION & USE OF TAX PAYER MONEY. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Will you call for measures to fairly tax corporations and the rich instead of increasing property taxes? We want the city to double the rate of the gross receipts tax and reinstate the personal property tax at its last stated rate of .004. Together, these measures will raise at least $100 million. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Thank you for your careful consideration. As a resident, I urge you to stand against Mayor Kenney’s austerity budget and instead stand with & protect ALL citizens of Philadelphia by passing a budget that protects our most vulnerable citizens by allowing city workers to do what they do best - provide robust and transformative services to all residents. %0D%0A %0D%0A

I'm a Philadelphia resident and I am contacting you to ask that you, Councilmember Richardson, work with Mayor Kenney to significantly revise the proposed city budget.  %0D%0A %0D%0A City Council must fully fund services working people rely on, rather than increasing the budget for Philadelphia’s police and worsening the racially disproportionate impact of COVID-19.  %0D%0A %0D%0A
I know you are committed to standing with Black and brown communities in Philadelphia, who have been hardest hit by COVID-19’s economic and health impacts. I believe that the most just and effective way to support Philadelphia’s recovery from COVID-19 is to pass progressive tax measures so that corporations and the ultra-wealthy are required to pay their fair share, instead of balancing the city’s budget on the backs of working Philadelphians. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Will you work to stop layoffs and budget cuts to city services that will disproportionately affect Philadelphia’s most disenfranchised residents and further entrench people in poverty? 
Will you work to reallocate funding from Philadelphia Police Department to city services such as our libraries, parks, homeless services, adult education, arts and culture? %0D%0A %0D%0A Increasing the PPD budget by $14 million while they use & incite violence to actively devastate our neighborhoods with extreme force in response to peaceful protests IS A CORRUPT ALLOCATION & USE OF TAX PAYER MONEY. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Will you call for measures to fairly tax corporations and the rich instead of increasing property taxes? We want the city to double the rate of the gross receipts tax and reinstate the personal property tax at its last stated rate of .004. Together, these measures will raise at least $100 million. %0D%0A %0D%0A
Thank you for your careful consideration. As a resident, I urge you to stand against Mayor Kenney’s austerity budget and instead stand with & protect ALL citizens of Philadelphia by passing a budget that protects our most vulnerable citizens by allowing city workers to do what they do best - provide robust and transformative services to all residents. %0D%0A %0D%0A
