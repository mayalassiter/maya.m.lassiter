        <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>Through disparate architectures, emerging processes, and an understanding of material sourcing, I want to show that novel devices can avoid the violence (both social and environmental) that underpins the traditional semiconductor industry. To be effective, beyond CMOS devices will need to be tailored to their specific social, spatial, economic, and environmental contexts. Questions of energy and material platform then become unavoidable.

I want to show how electronic fabrication is enhanced, rather than limited, by this fact.</p>
        
      <h2 id="read-me">Current Work</h2>
        <p> I am a GEM University Fellow pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of <a href="https://www.chamanzarlab.com/">the Chamanzar group</a> working on polymer neural probes for optogenetics applications. I am also a teaching assistant for the undergraduate in-lab curriculum and work as a student staff member at the <a href="http://www.nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Nanofabrication facility</a>. </p>

      <h3 id="optogenetics">Probes for Optogenetics</h3>
        <p>I am working on developing a fabrication process for biocompatible, flexible, polymer waveguides. Our work focuses on co-locating nerural recording and optical stimulation volumes in the brain. A recent poster can be seen <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/nextman.pdf?raw=True">here</a>. </p> <p>We hope these probes can be used for basic neuroscience research as they are flexible and higher density than presently available neural probes. The early stage of my research was to develop a light source bonding processes for discrete laser diode packages. I am now working to create a procedrue for an in-vivo implantation technique.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-assistant">In-Lab Teaching</h3>
        <p>My work as a Teaching Assistant began as a lab section TA for the undergraduate analog circuit core course for four semesters. Additionally, throughout summer 2018, I am also working to redesign the lab resources and tutorial material for all undergraduate core courses. We are writing guides, redesigning lab activities, and creating video content to better support students throughout the introductory, and core 200-level ECE courses. My work will help undergraduate students have a more cohesive experience in-lab across the core courses.</p>
        
<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>
<p>My previous work has varied from designing solar power systems to creating accesible robotics for special education. The following projects show some of this work.</p>
        <h3 id="piezoelectric-resonators">Piezoelectric Resonators</h3>
        <p>I took the microelecticsystems (MEMS) course sequence over the 2017-18 academic year. This involved a theory based course introducing the design and analysis of MEMS. We also did simulations in COMSOL. My final project for the Fall semester was designing a <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/mems_report.pdf?raw=True">multi-mode, multi-geometry scheme</a> for reconfigurable radios. The second course in the MEMS sequence is a lab-based course in which we fabricate and characterize Aluminum Nitride resonators.</p>
<h3 id="hall-effect">Meso-scale Sensor Fabrication</h3>
<p>My senior capstone project completed in the spring of 2017 focus on fabricating Hall effect sensors in a cheap, repeatable way without the use of a clean room facility. We created funcitoning p-type Si based Hall Effect sensors via electroless Nickel plating. By using the relative intensity from multiple Hall elements, a basic proximity sensor can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="compassionate-engineering">Compassionate Engineering</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a member of the four-person <a href="https://www.techbridgeworld.org/istep/" target="_blank">iSTEP team</a> working with the <a href="http://www.mathrublindschool.org/">Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind</a>. My teammates were <a href="http://www.amalnanavati.com/">Amal Nanavati</a>, <a href="http://erikpintar.com/">Erik Pintar</a>, and <a href="http://www.minnar.com/">Minnar Xie</a>.  iSTEP is a research fellowship advised by <a href="http://www.techbridgeworld.org/" target="_blank">TechBridgeWorld</a>. Our ten week internship was based in Bangalore, India. One of our projects was to initiate a 9-month study, funded by the Fetzer Institute, observing the process of Compassionate Engineering. This study aims to look at the efficacy and accessibility of the Braille Tutors developed by TechBridgeWorld. We also worked with the Mathru Center for the Deaf and Differently Abled. The main project I designed and created was Speak Up!: a suite of voice powered games. During our time there we iterated on an effective technology for the schoolâ€™s particular circumstance. Speak Up was created with accesible manuals and teacher training that enabled classroom use of the tools more than two years later.</p>
