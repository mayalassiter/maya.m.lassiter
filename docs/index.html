      <h2 id="read-me">Current Work</h2>
        <p> I am a GEM University Fellow pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the Chamanzar Group working on polymer neural probes for optogenetics applications. I am also a teaching assistant for the undergraduate course: Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits and work as a student staff member at the <a href="http://www.nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Nanofabrication facility</a>. </p>

      <h3 id="optogenetics">Optogenetics</h3>
        <p>I am working on developing a fabrication process for biocompatible, flexible, polymer waveguides. Our work focuses on co-locating nerural recording and optical stimulation volumes in the brain. A recent poster can be seen <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/nextman.pdf?raw=True">here</a>. </p> <p>We hope these probes can be used for neuroscience research. The early stages of my research has been to develop light source bonding processes such as using a single optical fiber and UV curable epoxy as seen below.</p>

<h3 id="piezoelectric-resonators">Piezoelectric Resonators</h3>
        <p>Over the 2017 academic year, the MEMS fabrication course sequence has introduced the theory, design, analysis, fabrication, and characterization of Aluminum Nitride resonators. The fall comprised of learning the physics of piezoelectric resonators and designing <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/mems_report.pdf?raw=True">multi-mode, multi-geometry scheme</a> for reconfigurable radios. The spring has included using the nanofab for both fabrication and characterization and will result in functioning devices.</p>
<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>
<p>My previous work has varied from designing solar power systems to creating accesible robotics for special education. The following projects show some of the work I have done over the past five years.</p>
<h3 id="hall-effect">Meso-scale Sensor Fabrication</h3>
<p>My senior capstone project completed in the spring of 2017 focues on fabricating Hall effect sensors in a cheap, repeatable way without the use of a clean room facility. We created funcitoning p-type Si based Hall Effect sensors via electroless Nickel plating.</p>
<h3 id="compassionate-engineering">Compassionate Engineering</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a member of the four-person <a href="https://www.techbridgeworld.org/istep/" target="_blank">iSTEP team</a> working with the <a href="http://www.mathrublindschool.org/">Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind</a>. My teammates were <a href="http://www.amalnanavati.com/">Amal Nanavati</a>, <a href="http://erikpintar.com/">Erik Pintar</a>, and <a href="http://www.minnar.com/">Minnar Xie</a>.  iSTEP is a research fellowship advised by <a href="http://www.techbridgeworld.org/" target="_blank">TechBridgeWorld</a>. Our ten week internship was based in Bangalore, India. One of our projects was to initiate a 9-month study, funded by the Fetzer Institute, observing the process of Compassionate Engineering. This study aims to look at the efficacy and accessibility of the Braille Tutors developed by TechBridgeWorld. We also worked with the Mathru Center for the Deaf and Differently Abled. The main project I worked on there was Speak Up, a suite of voice powered games. During our time there we iterated on an effective technology for the schoolâ€™s particular circumstance. Speak Up was created with accesible manuals and teacher training that enabled classroom use of the tools more than two years later.</p>
        <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>I hope that my work on device physicsc can change how and why people use technology. I want to change the social and environmental impact of devices through both their affect and efficacy.</p>
