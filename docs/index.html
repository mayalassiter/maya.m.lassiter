<p>A Pedagogy for Device Design

My interest in technology as narrative construction is contributing to my studies in device physics and nano-fabrication. Modern computers have several critical points of under-design. This is due to the normalization of computers being abstracted away from the user. Computers – after being a profession – were not public facing technologies. Computing still hides behind black-box abstractions even when computers are no longer primarily used for national security and defense. Holding on to this history has led our modern computers to hide both users understanding the inner-workings of our devices as well as limit the accountability of supply chain sourcing. Devices need an intentional pedagogy behind their fabrication, which should include the both consumer and the post-consumer (here I am thinking directly about second generation life cycles of devices like that seen across rural Africa that catalyzed mesh network communications). More intentional electronic fabrication methods will directly connect users with the entire process behind the device – rather than the black box abstractions we have become used to.

I think that device transparency can lead to holding both producers and consumers to higher standards. I want to investigate responsible and renewable product fabrication methods as a way to broaden agency as well as responsibility for our modern computing landscape. I have been exploring this while wrapping up my undergraduate time at Carnegie Mellon. I hope it leads to further considering disparate materials and new spaces for device innovation. Perhaps beyond CMOS technologies will democratize away from necessitating billion dollar foundries and can become adaptable manufacturing practices that will leave less of a footprint on electronic production.

 

Disrupting Semiconductors

My work in and out of the classroom has introduced me to semiconductor physics and the coming changes to the field. I think that there are important changes coming to semiconductors and that we will need to be more agile than ever before if we want to keep device physics in the conversation of emerging technologies. While this may be due to a slowing of Moore’s Law, I think that revolutionary changes to underlying factors of cost and scale will bring about a new age of semiconductor innovation.</p>
