      <h2 id="read-me">Current Work</h2>
        <p> I am a GEM University Fellow pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the Chamanzar Group working on polymer neural probes for optogenetics applications. I am also a teaching assistant for the undergraduate course: Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits and work as a student staff member at the <a href="http://www.nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Nanofabrication facility</a>. </p>

      <h3 id="optogenetics">Optogenetics</h3>
        <p>I am working on developing a fabrication process for biocompatible, flexible, polymer waveguides. Our work focuses on co-locating nerural recording and optical stimulation volumes in the brain. A recent poster can be seen <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/nextman.pdf?raw=True">here</a>. </p> <p>We hope these probes can be used for neuroscience research as they are flexible and higher density than presently available neural probes. The early stage of my research has been to develop light source bonding processes such as using a single optical fiber and UV curable epoxy as seen below.</p>

<h3 id="piezoelectric-resonators">Piezoelectric Resonators</h3>
        <p>I took the microelecticsystems (MEMS) course sequence over the 2017-18 academic year. This involved a course introducing the theory, design, and analysis of MEMS. The second course in the sequence focuses on hands on lab experience fabricating and characterizing Aluminum Nitride resonators. My final project for the Fall semester was designing a <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/mems_report.pdf?raw=True">multi-mode, multi-geometry scheme</a> for reconfigurable radios.</p>
<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>
<p>My previous work has varied from designing solar power systems to creating accesible robotics for special education. The following projects show some of this work.</p>
<h3 id="hall-effect">Meso-scale Sensor Fabrication</h3>
<p>My senior capstone project completed in the spring of 2017 focus on fabricating Hall effect sensors in a cheap, repeatable way without the use of a clean room facility. We created funcitoning p-type Si based Hall Effect sensors via electroless Nickel plating. By using the relative intensity from multiple Hall elements, a basic proximity sensor can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="compassionate-engineering">Compassionate Engineering</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a member of the four-person <a href="https://www.techbridgeworld.org/istep/" target="_blank">iSTEP team</a> working with the <a href="http://www.mathrublindschool.org/">Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind</a>. My teammates were <a href="http://www.amalnanavati.com/">Amal Nanavati</a>, <a href="http://erikpintar.com/">Erik Pintar</a>, and <a href="http://www.minnar.com/">Minnar Xie</a>.  iSTEP is a research fellowship advised by <a href="http://www.techbridgeworld.org/" target="_blank">TechBridgeWorld</a>. Our ten week internship was based in Bangalore, India. One of our projects was to initiate a 9-month study, funded by the Fetzer Institute, observing the process of Compassionate Engineering. This study aims to look at the efficacy and accessibility of the Braille Tutors developed by TechBridgeWorld. We also worked with the Mathru Center for the Deaf and Differently Abled. The main project I designed and created was Speak Up!: a suite of voice powered games. During our time there we iterated on an effective technology for the schoolâ€™s particular circumstance. Speak Up was created with accesible manuals and teacher training that enabled classroom use of the tools more than two years later.</p>
        <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>I hope that my work on device physics can change how and why people use technology. The internet of things requires more than system compactness and computation power. A direct (and responsible) interface with physical phenomena, through devices of various media, will also be necessary. To be effective, such systems will need to be tailored to their specific social, spatial, economic, and environmental contexts. Questions of energy and material platform then become unavoidable.

I want to investigate how electronic fabrication processes can work on the nano scale with earth abundant materials to open doors for novel devices.</p>
