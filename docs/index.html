      <h2 id="read-me">Current Work</h2>
        <p> I am pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the Chamanzar Group working on polymer neural probes for optogenetics applications. I am also a teaching assistant for the undergraduate course: Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits. </p>

      <h3 id="optogenetics">Optogenetics</h3>
        <p>I am working on developing a fabrication process for biocompatible, flexible, polymer waveguides. Our work focuses on co-locating nerural recording and optical stimulation volumes in the brain. A recent poster can be seen <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/nextman.pdf?raw=True">here</a>. </p> <p>We hope these probes can be used for neuroscience research. The early stages of my research has been to develop light source bonding processes such as using a single optical fiber and UV curable epoxy as seen below.</p>

<h3 id="piezoelectric-resonators">Piezoelectric Resonators</h3>
        <p>Over the 2017 academic year, the MEMS fabrication course sequence has introduced the theory, design, analysis, fabrication, and characterization of Aluminum Nitride resonators. The project has included using the <a href="http://www.nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Nanofabrication facility</a>.</p>
<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>
<p>My previous work has taken me around the world on both business and academic ventures. The following projects show some of the work I have completed over the past five years.</p>
<h3 id="hall-effect">Meso-scale Sensor Fabrication</h3>
<p>My senior capstone project hoped to fabricate Hall effect sensors in a cheap, repeatable way without the use of a clean room facility.</p>
<h3 id="compassionate-engineering">Compassionate Engineering</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I was an iSTEP team member.</p>
