<h1 id="previous-work">My previous work has included fabrication and compassion.</h1>
<p>My previous work has varied from designing solar power systems to creating accesible robotics for special education. The following projects show some of this work.</p>
         <h3 id="ll-summer">Advanced Imagers at MITLL</h2>
  <p>Throughout the summer of 2019 I worked in the <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/advanced-technology/advanced-imager-technology">the Advanced Imager Technology group</a> where I explored new charge coupled device architectures and characterization methods.</p>      

      <h3 id="optogenetics">Probes for Optogenetics</h3>
        <p>I developed a packaging process for biocompatible, flexible, polymer waveguides. Our work focused on co-locating nerural recording and optical stimulation volumes on a flexible substrate in the brain. A recent poster can be seen <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/nextman.pdf?raw=True">here</a>. </p> <p>We hope these probes can be used for basic neuroscience research as they are flexible and higher density than presently available neural probes. The early stage of my research was to develop a light source bonding processes for discrete laser diode packages.</p>
       
<h3 id="teaching-assistant">Lab Based Teaching</h3>
        <p>My work as a Teaching Assistant began as a lab section TA for the undergraduate analog circuit core course for four semesters. Additionally, throughout summer 2018, I worked to redesign the lab resources and tutorial material for all undergraduate core courses. I wrote guides, redesigned lab activities, and created video content to better support students throughout the introductory, and core 200-level ECE courses. My work will help undergraduate students have a more cohesive experience in-lab across the core courses.</p>
        <h3 id="piezoelectric-resonators">Piezoelectric Resonators</h3>
        <p>I took the microelecticsystems (MEMS) course sequence over the 2017-18 academic year. This involved a theory based course introducing the design and analysis of MEMS. We also did simulations in COMSOL. My final project for the Fall semester was designing a <a href="http://mayalassiter.github.io/website/mems_report.pdf?raw=True">multi-mode, multi-geometry scheme</a> for reconfigurable radios. The second course in the MEMS sequence is a lab-based course in which we fabricate and characterize Aluminum Nitride resonators.</p>
<h3 id="hall-effect">Meso-scale Sensor Fabrication</h3>
<p>My senior capstone project completed in the spring of 2017 focus on fabricating Hall effect sensors in a cheap, repeatable way without the use of a clean room facility. We created funcitoning p-type Si based Hall Effect sensors via electroless Nickel plating. By using the relative intensity from multiple Hall elements, a basic proximity sensor can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="solar-racing">Carnegie Mellon Solar Racing</h3>
<p>As a part of CMSR we designed, fabricated, and raced a ~3 meter solar powered speed boat. Built for a multi-day race throughout The Netherlands, I was on the field-team responsible for the race-site build, operation, and pilot for race segments in The Netherlands along with an exhibition in Monaco.</p>
        
<h3 id="compassionate-engineering">Compassionate Engineering</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a member of the four-person <a href="https://www.techbridgeworld.org/istep/" target="_blank">iSTEP team</a> working with the <a href="http://www.mathrublindschool.org/">Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind</a>. My teammates were <a href="http://www.amalnanavati.com/">Amal Nanavati</a>, <a href="http://erikpintar.com/">Erik Pintar</a>, and <a href="http://www.minnar.com/">Minnar Xie</a>.  iSTEP is a research fellowship advised by <a href="http://www.techbridgeworld.org/" target="_blank">TechBridgeWorld</a>. Our ten week internship was based in Bangalore, India. One of our projects was to initiate a 9-month study, funded by the Fetzer Institute, observing the process of Compassionate Engineering. This study aims to look at the efficacy and accessibility of the Braille Tutors developed by TechBridgeWorld. We also worked with the Mathru Center for the Deaf and Differently Abled. The main project I designed and created was Speak Up!: a suite of voice powered games. During our time there we iterated on an effective technology for the schoolâ€™s particular circumstance. Speak Up was created with accesible manuals and teacher training that enabled classroom use of the tools more than two years later.</p>
