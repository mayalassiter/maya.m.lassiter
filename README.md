## Current Projects
This is where I will introduce my purpose and how I hope to continue disrupting the current state of electronic fabrication and the digital divide.

### Previous Work

This is where my previous work will be shown and I potentially link to other pages.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mayalassiter/website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
